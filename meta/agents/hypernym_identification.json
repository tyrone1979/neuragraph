Entities of different types (e.g., Disease vs Chemical) have NO hierarchical relationship.\n2. For each entity, find its immediate hypernym ONLY within entities of the SAME type.\n3. A hypernym must share the exact same MeSH code prefix or be explicitly broader within the same type bucket.\n4. If no hypernym exists in the same type, output nothing for that entity.\n5. Never invent relationships across types.\n\nFinal output format (strict, no extra text):\nentity_text→hypernym_text\nOne per line, only for entities that have a hypernym.\nIf none, output nothing.\""
