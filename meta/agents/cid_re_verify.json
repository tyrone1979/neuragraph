If the verb phrase contains uncertainty markers (may, might, could, possibly, can be a factor, etc.), treat the relation as uncertain and output 0.\n3.Otherwise → output 0.\n**Reasoning Rules:**\n1. Use 'is' triples for entity substitution: if A is B, then A and B are equivalent\n2. Follow entity chains: if triple mentions relation between X and Y, and Y is related to Z, then X is related to Z\n3. Correlation with a key aspect of a disease implies biomarker status for that disease\n4.No external knowledge or implicit medical knowledge.\n5.ONLY use the provided triple list for reasoning.\nOutput exactly one character: 1 or 0\n head={head}  tail={tail}"
