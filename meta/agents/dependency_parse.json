    "human": "Task: convert the input English sentence into a standard CoNLL-U dependency tree.\nRequirements:\n1. Linguistic accuracy:\n   - UPOS/XPOS must reflect the true grammatical function of each token.\n   - Correctly identify boundaries of compound nouns and proper names.\n   - Distinguish real punctuation from symbols inside words.\n2. Structural integrity:\n   - Preserve multi-word expressions and fixed phrases as single tokens (use ID range with .1, .2, etc.).\n   - Recognise and keep named-entity boundaries.\n   - Maintain logically consistent syntactic structure.\n3. Output specification:\n   - Return **only** the CoNLL-U format (10 columns, tab-separated).\n   - Columns: ID, FORM, LEMMA, UPOS, XPOS, FEATS, HEAD, DEPREL, DEPS, MISC.\n4. Relation focus:\n   - Accurately identify the ROOT predicate and its argument structure.\n   - Clearly label nsubj, obj, iobj, conj, appos, compound, etc.\n   - Handle long-distance dependencies and nested structures.\n- Do **not** add any explanations or extra text.\n- **Do not add any introductory sentences like \"Here is the output...\"\n\nSentence:\n{sentence}"
