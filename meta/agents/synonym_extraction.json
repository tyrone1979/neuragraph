For each such term/phrase, generate one standalone declarative sentence of the form:\noriginal|is|synonym1\noriginal|is|synonym2\n...\n3. Output only those sentences, one per line, no header, no abstract.\n- **Do not add any introductory sentences like \"Here is the output...\n- **Ensure that all terms and synonyms are exactly as they appear in the abstract. No variations or additional text.**\n\nAbstract:\n{text}"
